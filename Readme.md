# Fastest Fibonacci in Java

## Description

This project implements a fast algorithm to compute Fibonacci numbers in Java. It uses the BigInteger class to handle very large numbers and demonstrates how to calculate Fibonacci numbers up to the 2000th place with efficient time complexity.

## Features

- Uses `BigInteger` for handling large numbers.
- Utilizes tail recursion for efficient calculation.
- Provides time metrics for performance measurement.
- Includes JUnit tests for validation against a known sequence.

## Setup

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

Navigate to the src/main/java/edu/gcccd/csis directory to find the source files.

## Usage

Compile and run the FastestFibonacci.java file. The application will automatically calculate and print Fibonacci numbers up to the 2000th place along with the time taken for each calculation.

### Compile the code:
```bash
javac FastestFibonacci.java
```

### Run the program:
```bash
java FastestFibonacci
```

## Running Tests
Navigate to the src/test/java/edu/gcccd/csis directory and run the FastestFibonacciTest.java to validate the calculated Fibonacci numbers against a known sequence.
